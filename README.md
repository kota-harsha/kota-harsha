<h2>Let's Peer Into Harsha Kota's Mind 🧐</h2>

It all started when my mom met my dad and they fell in love and had me. Hi, I’m Harsha, and my life is kinda crazy 🤪 I am an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am an active learner who is always fascinated by emerging technologies. Outside of Tech, I like to break a leg 🎭 and break a sweat 👟
